1. Basic types: numbers, strings and boolean
2. Aggregate: arrays and struct
3. reference types: pointers, slices, functions, channels, maps
4. Interfaces.

- For Implicit conversion:<new_type>(value/old_variable)
- Remember that float has to be either float32 or float64 explicitly, otherwise it is an error.
- Modern **64-bit processors** handle float64 operations **natively**, so there's often almost no difference in arithmetic speed.
